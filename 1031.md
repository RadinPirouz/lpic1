* Invoke commands inside and outside the defined path

**Terms and Utilities:**

**What is The "bash"?**

On most Linux systems a program called **bash acts as the shell** program. bash stands for **Bourne Again SHell**, an enhanced version of the original Unix shell program, sh, written by Steve Bourne

Besides, There are other shell programs that can be installed in a Linux system. These include: ksh, tcsh and zsh.

**Standard Input, Standard Output and Standard Error**

In general, a command (a program):

* Gets data to process from standard input or **stdin **(default: keyboard).
* Returns processed data to standard output or **stdout **(default: screen).
* If program execution causes errors, error messages are sent to standard error or **stderr **(default: screen).

### echo

The syntax for echo is: `echo [option(s)] [string(s)]`


```
[root@centos7-1 ~]# echo lpic1
lpic1
```

```
[root@centos7-1 ~]# echo -n lpic1
lpic1[root@centos7-1 ~]#
```
#### Special Characters or Meta Characters

What makes a character special? If it has a meaning beyond its literal meaning, a meta-meaning, then we refer to it as a special character or metacharacters  like : **``| & ; ( ) < > [ ] { } * ! ? ` ' " $ \ / # ``**

**pound sign (#)**

Everything written after a pound sign (#) is ignored by the shell.

```
[root@centos7-1 temp]# ls # ls /etc
```


**end of line backslash \\**

Lines ending in a backslash are continued on the next line.

**escaping special characters  **

The backslash  character enables the use of control characters, but without the shell interpreting it, this is called **escaping characters**.

```
[root@centos7-1 ~]# echo hello | by
bash: by: command not found...
[root@centos7-1 ~]# echo hello \| by
hello | by
[root@centos7-1 ~]# echo hello ; by
hello
bash: by: command not found...
[root@centos7-1 ~]# echo hello \; by
hello ; by
```
Use the`-e`option to enable certain backslash **escaped characters** to have special meaning.
