# 103.1. Work on the command line

### **103.1 Work on the command line**

**Weight**: 4

**Description:**Candidates should be able to interact with shells and commands using the command line. The objective assumes the Bash shell.

**Key Knowledge Areas:**

* Use single shell commands and one line command sequences to perform basic tasks on the command line
* Use and modify the shell environment including defining, referencing and exporting environment variables
* Use and edit command history
* Invoke commands inside and outside the defined path

**Terms and Utilities:**

* bash
* echo
* env
* export
* pwd
* set
* unset
* man
* uname
* history
* .bash_history

**What is The "bash"?**

On most Linux systems a program called **bash acts as the shell** program. bash stands for **Bourne Again SHell**, an enhanced version of the original Unix shell program, sh, written by Steve Bourne

Besides, There are other shell programs that can be installed in a Linux system. These include: ksh, tcsh and zsh.

**Standard Input, Standard Output and Standard Error**

In general, a command (a program):

* Gets data to process from standard input or **stdin **(default: keyboard).
* Returns processed data to standard output or **stdout **(default: screen).
* If program execution causes errors, error messages are sent to standard error or **stderr **(default: screen).

### echo

The syntax for echo is: `echo [option(s)] [string(s)]`


```
[root@centos7-1 ~]# echo lpic1
lpic1
```

```
[root@centos7-1 ~]# echo -n lpic1
lpic1[root@centos7-1 ~]#
```
#### Special Characters or Meta Characters

What makes a character special? If it has a meaning beyond its literal meaning, a meta-meaning, then we refer to it as a special character or metacharacters  like : **``| & ; ( ) < > [ ] { } * ! ? ` ' " $ \ / # ``**

**pound sign (#)**

Everything written after a pound sign (#) is ignored by the shell.

```
[root@centos7-1 temp]# ls # ls /etc
```


**end of line backslash \\**

Lines ending in a backslash are continued on the next line.

**escaping special characters  **

The backslash  character enables the use of control characters, but without the shell interpreting it, this is called **escaping characters**.

```
[root@centos7-1 ~]# echo hello | by
bash: by: command not found...
[root@centos7-1 ~]# echo hello \| by
hello | by
[root@centos7-1 ~]# echo hello ; by
hello
bash: by: command not found...
[root@centos7-1 ~]# echo hello \; by
hello ; by
```
Use the`-e`option to enable certain backslash **escaped characters** to have special meaning.

Escape sequence	Function                                               

\a		Alert (bell)                                          
\b		Backspace                                             
\c		Suppress trailing newline (same function as -n option) 
\f		Form feed (clear the screen on a video display)        
\n		New line                                               
\r		Carriage return                                        
\t		Horizontal tab                                         
\v		vertical tab                                           

Some examples:

```
[root@centos7-1 ~]# echo -e "Lets \vstart \vlearning \vLinux"
Lets 
     start 
           learning 
                    Linux
[root@centos7-1 ~]# echo -e "Lets \tstart \tlearning \tLinux"
Lets     start     learning     Linux
```

**Semi-Colon** (**;**) : The succeeding commands will execute regardless of the exit status of the command that precedes it.

```
[root@centos7-1 ~]# ls /root/ ; ls /home/
```
**Logical AND** (**&&**) : This command that follows this operator will execute only if the preceding command executes successfully.

```
[root@centos7-1 ~]# true && ls /home/
```
**Logical OR** (**||**) : The command that follows will execute only if the preceding command fails.

```
[root@centos7-1 ~]# false || ls /home/
```

### env

By default, "env" command lists all the current environment variables.

```
[root@centos7-1 ~]# env
XDG_VTNR=1
XDG_SESSION_ID=1
HOSTNAME=centos7-1
SHELL=/bin/bash
.
.
.
```
* **PWD**: The current working directory.

> We use pwd command to see that:
>
> ```
> [root@centos7-1 ~]# pwd
> /root
> [root@centos7-1 ~]# cd /etc/
> [root@centos7-1 etc]# pwd
> /etc
> ```
